Graphics
LOWERLEFTCORNER
PDF files support elementary drawing operations as part of their syntax. These are vector graphics and include basic geometrical objects like lines, curves, circles, 
rectangles including specifying colors.
The syntax for such operations is defined in “A Operator Summary” on page 643 of the Adobe PDF References. Specifying these operators for a PDF page happens in 
its contents objects.
PyMuPDF implements a large part of the available features via its Shape class, which is comparable to notions like “canvas” in other packages (e.g. reportlab).
A shape is always created as a child of a page, usually with an instruction like shape = page.new_shape(). The class defines numerous methods that perform drawing 
operations on the page’s area. For example, last_point = shape.draw_rect(rect) draws a rectangle along the borders of a suitably defined rect = pymupdf.Rect(...).
